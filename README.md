# An efficient method for obtaining user-defined polygonal regions of interest constrained by arbitrary obstacles

Geometric optimization has been frequently studied in a recurrent way, where geometric optimization has been fundamental to developing more complete algorithms. Regions of interest can be obtained as user-defined polygons as a first step towards many practical applications. This algorithm presents an efficient method for computing all possible polygons contained within regions of interest bounded by arbitrary obstacles. The algorithm presented solves two open geometric problems. First, a generalization of the maximum empty rectangle problem (MER problem) is made. Second, new obstacles could be added to the initial polygon, such as intersecting or non-intersecting segments. The developed algorithm calculates all the simple polygons with the maximum area or perimeter contained within the region of interest. The user can define the polygon to be calculated (triangle, quadrilateral, pentagon, hexagon, etc.) as well as the desired solution: maximum area or maximum perimeter.
